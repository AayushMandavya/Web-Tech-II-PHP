Prime Number of Not Algorithm:

Step 1: Declare a function named isprime and variable $n for storing number to be checked.
Step 2: Create a for loop with initial condition defined by $x=2 to run till it's smaller than given input.
Step 3: Check if the modulus of given number by $x(2) is 0 .Return 0 if modulus is 0.
Step 4: Return 1 elsewise
Step 5: If the returning value is equal to 0 then the number isn't a prime number.
Step 6: If the returning value is equal to 1 then the number is a prime number.
Step 7: End
